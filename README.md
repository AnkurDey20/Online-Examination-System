# Online Examination System
Implementation of an online test consisting of 10 mutiple choice questions(MCQs) in Java Swing.


Swing API is a set of extensible GUI Components to ease the developer's life to create JAVA based Front End/GUI Applications. It is built on top of AWT API and acts as a replacement of AWT API since it has almost every control corresponding to AWT controls.

I have used java arrays to store the questions, options and answers. You can also use collection framework or a database in place of array.
This project allows the examinee to mark questions for review and then reconsider them before going to the results.

# Execution is as follows:-

Open to suggestions :)
